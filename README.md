The Black Oak Engineering (BOE) Simple Data Acquistion (SimpleDaq) has a standard Arduino Uno R3 Shield pinout.  The board is smaller than an Arduino Uno.  It will work with any host that supports the standard interface.  It provides four channels of analog input, each with two input ranges.  These are buffered by an op amp and then connected to the four standard analog pins (A3:A0).  The ADC on the host may then convert these signals. Note, since most ADCs have a fluctuating input impedance due to their basic operation, they cannot generally be fed ‘raw’, unbuffered signals; the fluctuation will combine with the output impedance of the source to create noise. The SimpleDaq also has a micro SD card holder for recording data.
